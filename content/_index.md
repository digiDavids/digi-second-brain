## Public vs Private Second Brain

Choose between **publishing and sharing your knowledge online or creating a private second brain**.

To create an **open second brain**, share your knowledge with others [by deploying this template](https://wowchemy.com/hugo-themes/) as a public website.

To create a **private second brain** either:

- After deploying your site above, [password protect your online second brain](https://docs.netlify.com/visitor-access/password-protection/) and configure your GitHub repo as **private**
- [Download this template](https://github.com/wowchemy/hugo-second-brain-theme) and [run the tool locally](https://wowchemy.com/docs/getting-started/install-hugo-extended/)
