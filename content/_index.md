Welcome to my **Second Brain** where I create **personal notes** and **knowledge bases** in my own way!!!

This diagram shows the basic steps involved in troubleshooting end-user issues. The user reports the issue to the support engineer, who then asks questions and collects information to try to understand the problem. The support engineer then investigates the issue and tries to resolve it. If the issue is not resolved, the process repeats until the issue is fixed.

Here are some of the questions that the support engineer might ask the user:

```markmap {height="500px"}

    * What is the exact error message?
    * What were you doing when the error occurred?
    * Have you tried restarting your computer?
    * Have you tried updating your software?

```

The support engineer might also need to collect information such as the user's operating system, browser, and hardware specifications.

Once the support engineer has enough information, they can investigate the issue. This might involve searching for solutions online, contacting the software vendor, or running diagnostic tests.

If the support engineer is able to resolve the issue, they will let the user know. The user can then thank the support engineer and close the ticket.

This is just a basic overview of the troubleshooting process. The specific steps involved will vary depending on the issue. However, this diagram should give you a good understanding of the general flow of the process.
